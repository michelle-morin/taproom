# _React Taproom_

#### React Fundamentals Independent Project for Epicodus, April 24, 2020

#### By Michelle Morin

## Description

_This application, built using Create React App, is a taproom where a bar can track their beer inventory._

## Specification user stories:

* A user is able to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, the user is able to see its name, brewery, price, and alcohol content (ABV).
* A user is able to submit a form to add a new keg to the list.
* A user is able to click on a keg to see its details page.
* A user is able to see how many pints are remaining in a keg (a full keg is assumed to include 124 pints). The pint quantity remaining in a keg is displayed on that keg's detail page.
* A user is able to click a "buy" button next to a keg whenever a pint is sold. This decreases the number of pints remaining by 1.
* When there are between 0 and 10 pints remaining in a keg, a user is able to see that the keg is almost gone (indicated on the "buy" button).
* A keg is unable to be poured from (pint count decremented) when the keg is empty. Instead, a user is able to see a note that the keg is empty.
* A user is able to delete a keg when it is empty (0 pints remaining).
